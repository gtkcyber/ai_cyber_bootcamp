    "In this lab, we will be working on the following use case:  You run your company's IT and want to make sure that your employees are not signing up for unauthorized services and creating shadow IT.  To do so, we will be building a model to idenfity account verification emails sent to company email addresses.\n",

    "## Finding SaaS Applications\n",
    "The basic approach is that we're going to look at the subjects of emails and compare that subject with the subject(s) of common account operations.  This initial approach starts with email verification emails, but could be expanded to other common SaaS operations such as 2FA, account creation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's read in the data.  As with other labs, this lab uses the `DATA_PATH` variable so if you moved the data anywhere outside of the repository, you will need to modify the `DATA_PATH` variable.  The dataset we will be using for this exercise is in the file `clean_email.csv` which contains approximately 140k email metadata events."
